#### Crimiplegia

Crimiplegia is an information based company that helps travelers from all over the world to understand potential risks better and feel safer when traveling to the US. Data is useless, unless is correctly interpreted; that is where Crimiplegia comes in. At Crimiplegia, we aim to interpret criminality data in the best way possible so that our users can travel more, and worry less.

We are a startup with two main components, and with two different development stages. First, we aim to generate a database that will unify over 18,000 databases containing criminality records from all over the US, translating the information and categorizing it. Through a series of APIs, we aim to generate software that pulls the data from all sources and stores it in our own databases. Second, we intend to design mathematical algorithms to analyze the information and present it in simplified way to our users.

The first stage of the company is to build Crimiplegiaâ€™s phone app in order to help our users understand potential risks and make conscious decisions when traveling. The app will extract millions of criminality records, analyze and interpret them. After building a user base, our second stage is to become data providers to companies who want to minimize risks by taking our data into consideration when making important decisions. For example, Fedex can find better routes, or a local entrepreneur can find a better location to start a coffee shop.
