#### Intraleagues
Just like athletes enjoy playing sports just their friends, gamers love playing games with their friends as well. Here at Intraleagues, we provide just that, a platform for an intramural league for video games where we set up weekly matches and give participants definitive rankings as a funnel to form a cohesive community.ï¿½
