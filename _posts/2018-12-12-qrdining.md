name: QR Code Dining
blurb: QR Code Dining's goal is to bring a better overall dining experience to restaurant diners and increase the workflow efficiency of the restaurants' operation. Our product can reduce the wait time of restaurant diners. By scanning QR codes, customers can add their names on restaurant�s waitlist, view detailed and pictured menu, place food orders, and pay online. Furthermore, we believe that restaurants are currently incurring many unnecessary costs, and that restaurants employees are dealing with tasks that can be done by machines. Our product can drastically reduce restaurants� operating costs and workloads.
