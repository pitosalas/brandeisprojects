name: Accountable
blurb: Accountable is the first ever mobile app for students working in groups. We help students manage their projects across multiple classes, and the nuances of dividing up tasks and completing them on time. Students who work hard in groups get rewarded for it. Whether that be a more individualized grade from the professor, an endorsement from peers on their Accountable profile page for being good at a certain skill or by taking their Accountability Report to potential employers to land that dream job. We do the organizational work so our students don't have to. Group work just got easier  and the cycle of free riders in the group work world? That's just been put to an end.
