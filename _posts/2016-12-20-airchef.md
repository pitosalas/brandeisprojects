name: AirChef
blurb: AirChef enables cooks to go online, either on mobile or on the web, and post meals that they know how to make. They would provide descriptions of the meals, ingredients used, allergy information, type of dish (e.g. Kosher, Vegetarian, etc.), dates for delivery availability and a bio attached to their profile. On the other hand, those looking to order food will be able search for meals based on criteria such as location, culinary style, ingredients, and cost. The cook will then prepare the meal and deliver the food to the person who ordered. Since this current business plan is focused around college campuses we assume that cooks will be able to deliver the food with relative ease. AirChef will obtain revenue through a fee based business plan in which we take a percentage of all sales.
