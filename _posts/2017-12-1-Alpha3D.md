blurb: Alpha3D is a web-based 3D printing service specifically for biomolecule models. Unlike what people imagined, 3D printing is actually a unpleasant and tedious process. Even printing a small object can be failed due to wrong settings like temperature. Printing a high quality model requires correctly set temperature, material, orientations, slicing and supports. Our secret is inside the black box. While we provide the users with an affordable price, our algorithms, materials used and hardwares will be optimized for this purpose to guarantee a care-free servic
