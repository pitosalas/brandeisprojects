name: Car Helper
blurb:  Car Helper aims at helping international students get access to cars in the US at a competitive price. We offer two services: long-term rental services and maintenance services. With our rental service, international students can now have a car during their time in the US and no longer have to worry about what to do with their cars when they graduate and return to their home country. Our maintenance service will connect customers with car issues to our network of trustworthy car maintenance companies, and customers can have access to the most reasonable service in the market.
