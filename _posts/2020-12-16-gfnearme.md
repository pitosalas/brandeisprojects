name: Gluten Free Near Me
blurb: Our goal is to deliver a digital app that is dedicated to locating closeby gluten-free restaurants. Unlike other food apps, it filters for different specificities and budgets and also avoids the health risks involved with unverified restaurants. Our customers are looking for clear, tangible solutions to the basic job of finding a restaurant that meet their gluten dietary needs without any of the financial discomfort, health risks, and emotional pains.
