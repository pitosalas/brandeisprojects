name: Game of Loans
blurb: By using Game of Loans, students will be encouraged to pay off their loan principal and interest early in order to save themselves time and money. By paying off their loan principal and interest early, they can avoid paying more interest than they would have had to, saving them possibly years of being in debt. Students will also learn to be more financially responsible than they would become just by taking a class on it because they will be more engaged with the process and will be provided with a convenient way to access their loans. Furthermore, that also means that the financial institutions that provide students with their student loans will also have less students defaulting on their loans.
