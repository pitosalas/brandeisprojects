blurb: AfterGlobe is a travel app that generates a unique travel plan based on a user’s interests and specifications. Users enter information such as what city they are visiting, how long the visit will be, their budget, what interests they have, who they will be traveling with, along with many others. The app then automatically generates a plan that includes housing, transportation, food, and activities for the entirety of the trip. AfterGlobe’s purpose is to take the burden off of the traveler of planning their entire trip.
