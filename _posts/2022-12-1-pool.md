name: Pool
blurb: Pool allows you to safely and effortlessly split purchases with anyone. Invite friends to your Pool Party and make secure transactions without the liability and anxiety of waiting for others to pay you back.Our product changes the paradigm of splitting, pushing consumers towards an escrow-style model of only paying money once everyone agrees on a transaction. By implementing a new product primitive of social payment pooling, we alleviate the financial burden on those who front large group transactions, and streamline groups-coordinated spending.
