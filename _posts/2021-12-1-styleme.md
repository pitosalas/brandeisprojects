name: StyleMe!
blurb: Style Me! is an outfit planning application that recommends users new outfits everyday based on the weather. Users have the ability to sign up for the application. Once they are registered, users can upload pictures of their clothes. We use an image recognation API to make the uploading process easier. Once the user has uploaded their clothes, they can generate a randomized outfit. We use a weather API to generate appropriate outfits & accessories for the day. We also use a color matching algorithm to make sure the outfit is stylish! Once the user selects the outfit, the clothes get put into a dirty pile and won't get suggested until the user marks them as "clean".
