name: PlanIt
blurb: There are about 150 million events - ranging from small birthday
parties to large corporate functions - happening per year in the
United States. To plan any one of these events requires time, money
and effort, navigating between different platforms until the perfect
plan is created. Even then, there is no guarantee your event will
really be as fun and successful as you hoped it to be. As a result, we
came up with PlanIt - an interactive (and social) platform that allows
for fast, low-cost, and easy planning of any type of event catered to
the individual user.
