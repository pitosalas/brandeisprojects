#### PlanIt
There are about 150 million events - ranging from small birthday
parties to large corporate functions - happening per year in the
United States. To plan any one of these events requires time, money
and effort, navigating between different platforms until the perfect
plan is created. Even then, there is no guarantee your event will
really be as fun and successful as you hoped it to be. As a result, we
came up with PlanIt: an interactive (and social) platform that allows
for fast, low-cost, and easy planning of any type of event catered to
the individual user.

At PlanIt, we help our users plan amazing events in no time. By simply
inputting their location, event preference, budget, and group size,
users are linked to various venues and independent professionals in
their area, forming business opportunities for all. In addition,
PlanIt will include a database of ‘premade’ events, creating a social
platform where all ‘planners’ can connect by sharing and reviewing
other users’ events. PlanIt’s revenue model will be based on some
combination of a subscription model, pay-per-click advertising, and
per-event fees. Our goal is to become your go-to application to
create, coordinate, and bring to life all your dream events.
