blurb: An online testing platform for Brandeis Computer Science classes. AutoGrader allows students to submit assignments to itself, which runs Junit test online instead of having a TA download and run the tests locally. Then TA can grade the coding style and update the students' grades on the website, and the professor can check the grades online and export them as csv file.
