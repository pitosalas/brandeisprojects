name: HomeSmart
blurb: The goal of HomeSmart is to reduce the stress and complexity of acquiring a smart home system by allowing users to identify the needs they currently have and having them purchase the equipment needed for their installation. Once each item arrives to the user, the app will walk them through set up and how to connect the platforms to other common hubs such as Alexa and Google Assistant.    HomeSmart will connect to most other platforms and will allow users to organize their devices to their liking.
