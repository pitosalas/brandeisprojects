name: PicFood
blurb: Our goal with PicFood is to change the way you look for food. When shopping for anything else online, it's easy to find a visual catalog with a preview of each item. However, this is not always the case when looking for what to eat. People love looking at images and videos of food, but websites like Yelp only show an unorganized glimpse of the dishes at any given restaurant. PicFood aims to show users all the delicious options restaurants have to offer in a vivid, mouth watering way.
