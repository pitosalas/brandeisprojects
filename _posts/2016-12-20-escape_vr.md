#### EscapeVR
EscapeVR is a virtual reality app for relaxation. Compatible with iOS and Android smartphones and any smartphone-compatible headset like Google Cardboard, EscapeVR lets you escape from the real world with calming 3D environments.

For this project we were primarily targeting university students as people with high levels of stress and a willingness to try new technology. We conducted interviews, surveys, and prototype tests with students to see if our product added value and if people were willing to use it.
