name: MakeBox
blurb: MakeBox is a subscription service that assists users in finding makeup products that work for their skin color and type. By taking a survey at the moment of subscription, our makeup experts can match the user with their makeup needs. We provide our users with 8-10 products which they then narrow down to 5, which are delivered to them every 3 months in a special makeup box. We take the time and stress away from buying makeup while still giving users fun and useful alternatives to their daily routine that work well for them.
