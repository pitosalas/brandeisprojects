blurb: Since customers still go to brick and mortar stores, and will continue to do so, we want to intercept their mobile activity right in the store. We designed a native in­store consumer app that provides an interactive and personalized experience in the store. This application combines features that commonly exist in online shopping while providing the benefits of brick ­and­ mortar retail stores.
