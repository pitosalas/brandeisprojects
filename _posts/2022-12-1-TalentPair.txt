name: TalentPair - Matching Making for Tech Startups 
blurb: TalentPair is a reverse job board targeting startups recruiting tech-related roles. We allow job seekers to build a well-rounded profile with their background, skills, experiences, and preferences that will be used to match them with the best fit job. In addition, we emphasize on utilizing personality tests as a tool to ensure the comptaibilty of job seekers with company’s culture. Recruiters can view, filter and reach out to job seekers that meet their requirements, using our platform’s matching and filtering algorithms. This solves the problem of large applicant pools, applicants not hearing back and mismatches between employers and employees.
