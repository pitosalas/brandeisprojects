### DoIt
Each morning, Alexa promises herself that she will go to the gym when she comes back from work. Having gained a few pants sizes, she is determined to lose a few pounds so she can fit into her clothes again and feel and look her best. However, Alexa often comes home late feeling exhausted and must choose whether to listen to Good Alexa or Bad Alexa. Good Alexa tells Alexa to go to the gym, reminding her how determined she was this morning. Bad Alexa, on the other hand, tells Alexa to stay home, watch TV, and eat snacks, telling her that she has worked hard and deserves a rest. Because she is so tired, Alexa listens to Bad Alexa. If she had DoIt, however, Alexa would have the motivation and incentive to listen to Good Alexa and go to the gym. By enabling her to bet her friend, James, when she has the motivation to go to the gym, and by connecting her smartphone or wearable to DoIt, Alexa would be very reluctant to miss her gym appointment because DoIt holds her accountable (and James does too). DoIt allows Alexa to raise the stakes and achieve two goals: become fitter and actually use the gym membership that she already paid for.
