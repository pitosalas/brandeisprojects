### What is this page?

This is a collection of student project "portfolio pages". At the end of each medium to large student project, we often ask a student or team of students to prepare a summary of their work as a Portfolio Page. It is really up to the students to decide exactly how they interpret that. Basically the goal is 'showcase' the work for external consumption.


<table id="projects" class="display">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Column 1</th>
            <th>Column 2</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1 Data 1</td>
            <td>Row 1 Data 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2 Data 1</td>
            <td>Row 2 Data 2</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
