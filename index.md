### What is this page?

This is a collection of student project "portfolio pages". At the end of each medium to large student project, we often ask a student or team of students to prepare a summary of their work as a Portfolio Page. It is really up to the students to decide exactly how they interpret that. Basically the goal is 'showcase' the work for external consumption.
